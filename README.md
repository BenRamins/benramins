### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If a thing doesn't exist, I like to build it. If it does, I like to improve it. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the following projects:
1) A web app to help long-term romantic couples manage their relationship. Think Salesforce for your relationship. 
2) A web app to help US high school students apply to college.
3) A web app to help individual investors make smarter choices. 
4) Freelance projects for clients - fullstack, leveraging Azure w/Node.js for the backend and Flutter/React for the front-end.  

- :sunglasses: I'm fairly ok with the following technologies:
1) Node.js
2) Cloud Computing / Azure
3) Flutter
4) React.js
5) Gatsby.js
6) SQL 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
1) React Native
2) C++
3) Arduino
4) Adobe XD

- âš¡ Fun fact: In another lifetime, I helped draft the first citizen guide and opinion survey on my home country's first constitution in over 50 years.
